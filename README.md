We has created a treasure hunt game for new students to complete during welcome 
week to help orientate students on campus while being an icebreaker to meet their peers. 
Students are able to solve clues on the app to find their way to locations around campus
in small groups and complete tasks when they arrive. The webapp also features a gamekeeper user 
profile which can be used to supervise the game and make changes.
