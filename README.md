We has created a treasure hunt game for new students to complete during welcome 
week to help orientate students on campus while being an icebreaker to meet their peers. 
Students are able to solve clues on the app to find their way to locations around campus
in small groups and complete tasks when they arrive. The webapp also features a gamekeeper user 
profile which can be used to supervise the game and make changes.

## How to play

**Student** :mortar_board:

Upon starting a game the players will be given a hint to help them find their way to one of the university resources. Players can use the 'FAQ' button to get help with frequently ocurring questions about the game or press the 'I need help' button to notify the gamekeeper that they feel unsafe or overwhelmed. Players can use the feed to keep track of the state of the game and use the 'Emoji buttons' for a fun and fast-paced way of communicating. When arriving at the intended resource, players must use the 'Open camera' button to scan a QR code and recieve their next hint. The game is finished when the players have been to all the resources on their route and scanned the QR codes.


**Gamekeeper** :game_die:

The gamekeeper has the ability to start and end a game using the 'Start/End game' button and can keep track of everything using a map of the university, a leaderboard and the feed. The map... The leaderboard will display all the rankings of the players and also what stage they are currently at. The gamekeeper can recieve help requests from players and keep track of the game state using the feed which the gamekeeper can also manually clear.
